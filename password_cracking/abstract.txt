Hash functions and password cracking

Cryptographic hash functions have been described as the workhorses of modern cryptography, having uses in message authentication, digital signatures and password verification.
But how do they work and how safe really are they?

In this talk I will introduce hash functions. We will discuss some of their use cases and also consider when they may fail us.
Following this I will give a live demo of password cracking using the software hashcat and one of our GPU equipped machines, which is capable of making 4 billion password attacks per second.

After this (hopefully) eye-opening demonstration, I will conclude by discussing how to set and manage passwords in a secure and safe manner.
