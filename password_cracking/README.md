# About

I gave this talk to Newcastle University's Maths, Stats and Physics
postgraduate forum in 2018.

I used one of the University's GPU machines to perform a live demonstration
of password cracking with the software hashcat. As such, the slides for the
presentation don't give the original talk much justice :(
