You'll see that there is already a talk titled "collective behaviour" in this repo.
However, for that talk I only had 12 minutes to present, and the talk was to be delivered
to a room of applied mathematicians.

For this talk, the audience was more general and I also had longer to present! Hence this
talk is intended to be less technical and more, dare I say, fun.
